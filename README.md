# COVID19_DATASET_CREATION_BOT
I have built a model which is able to fetch different statistica related to the current status of covid in different countries across the globe. we can get an updated covid dataset by executing the code written in the program to build the model.

In this project , i used selenium ,webdriver . selenium is a library which helps in website automation with python .with this library you can make connections to any website or webpage over the internet.

selenium actually requires a webdriver to interact with the web page.These interactions are simply reading finding information and giving information to the webpage.
